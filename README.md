# description
The bot is a scraper bot designed for players of the game Dofus Touch. It helps with quests and missions, which can often be complicated to complete on your own. Many players find themselves constantly searching online for guidance on where to go, how to complete quests, or where to find specific resources or items. My bot is the first of its kind in the Dofus Touch community, providing information in seconds through a simple private message.

The bot uses two prefixes to find the information you're looking for: !quest and !chemin. By sending a message to the bot with one of these prefixes followed by the name of the quest or path, you can quickly get the help you need. For example, you can send !quest Star Ski et Dutch, !quest Il y a un os, de Wabbit, !chemin du Kimbo, or !chemin Dark Vlad.

There are hundreds of quests and paths in Dofus Touch, and these are just four examples of what the bot can do. It's a valuable resource for the Dofus Touch community, offering fast and reliable assistance with their in-game adventures.
